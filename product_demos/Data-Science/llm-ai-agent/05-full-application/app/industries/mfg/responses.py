We can prioritize this order in the assembly queue\n\nWould you like me to proceed with any of these options to meet next week's deadline?",

Since the #MFG-2025-789 has 25,000 units, that increases the order cost by $17,500 or 10%. \n\nQuality impact:\n- Substituting this part means a slight change in the in-line QC process. While this will not change the number of samples to be QC checked, the line supervisor needs to refer to the Product Engineering manual for the QC steps.\n\nWould you like me to go ahead and prepare the memo to swap the parts?",
